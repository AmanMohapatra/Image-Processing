# Image-Processing
This project is for processing an image and smoothening the uneven surface of the character.

The model that was created was 42 MB of size because this model is treined by feeding in more than 7000 images and Github's file upload size limit is of 25 MB
I tried to compress and zip it but even after zipping it it was 34 MB. Still greater than the limit.

So to solve this problem I've uploaded 2 python files. 
1. "train.py" : which will train the model and also create a model.
2. "test.py" : Which will use the model to get the outcome.
